# CareerScope v12 engineering progress

## Activation checkpoint

- Owner approval: OA-2026-10-20-01, dated 20 October 2026.
- Activation: APPROVED_PENDING_GOVERNANCE_INTEGRATION.
- Existing baseline: `45d6d35691bd5d41257da4f3988acd9a89c7d2ea`.
- Development integration: `codex/dev`; current task: governance activation.
- Main is not modified, pushed or merged. No production/provider actions performed.
- Existing GitHub main protection query returned HTTP 404 (not protected); branch
  rules query returned an empty array. No repository setting was changed.
- No active tracked governance/work-authority files existed at baseline; AGENTS.md
  was ignored. This owner-authorized transition restores a thin entry point and
  one canonical contract, without removing existing code, designs or migrations.

## Verified baseline recovery evidence

External artifact handle: `governance-20261019T182853851Z/careerscope.bundle`.
The actual private storage path is recorded in the owner's external assessment,
not exposed in this public repository. Bundle SHA256:
`E2222B8322930ECCAE63E508FD9840674A43EAB97A330D469CA6760C6422D68D`.

`git bundle create --all`, `git bundle verify`, restore clone and `git fsck --full`
all exited 0. Restored HEAD matched the baseline; original branch/tag inventories
were main-only/no tags. All recorded refs remain in the bundle. Ignored secrets,
environment files and runtime data were not read or copied. Private recovery clone
is retained for inspection; this is source recovery, not production DB backup.

## Current executed local evidence

At baseline on bundled Node 24.19.0, `npm run gates:test` exited 0: Node policy
tests 4/4, privacy tests 3/3 and scan, deployment decision fixtures, EOL scan,
lint, strict typecheck (45 test files), and unit tests 42/42. No skips/failures.
These are existing-code checks, not v12 launch acceptance or measured coverage.

Current `npm audit --json`: exit 1, five high/seven moderate, zero critical.
Production-only audit: exit 1, three moderate, zero high/critical. No dependency
changed or finding waived. High findings block affected integration until assessed
and remediated; a thresholded production-only command does not clear the full audit.

## Next work and boundaries

Independent governance review: separate `governance_review` session returned
APPROVE with no blocking findings for the seven-file transition; it independently
checked all five supplied source hashes, relevant clauses, public-record privacy,
scope and activation boundaries. Its scope was governance only, not product
certification; supplied baseline test/backup/hosted-query evidence was not rerun
by that reviewer. Format/privacy/EOL/diff checks for the transition passed.

First independently review/commit/verify this governance transition. Then complete
the source-grounded gap/test/category matrices and critical-path audit before
runtime implementation. Prioritize security/data integrity and approval-compliant
source policy, followed by the complete v12 launch core in dependency order.
No percentage is claimed until the requirement denominator is derived and verified.
Historical R1 cleanup reports remain history, not v12 implementation proof.
